          Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kagisho M. Makoti, an industrial engineer turned full-on software dev enthusiast who's been
          geeking out on computers since forever. Picture this: the family tech support guy voluntold to fix laptops,
          banish viruses, and resurrect fried hard drivesâ€”now slinging code like a boss on my rock-solid Arch Linux
          setup (yay is my morning coffee â˜• because who needs Windows when everything just works?).
        </p>
        <p>
          With a BSc in Industrial Engineering from Wits (Python, MATLAB, and ops magic included), I've crushed it at
          NestlÃ©â€”slashing Ricoffy waste by 90%, boosting Bar-One output, saving R100k weekly, and cutting complaints 50%
          with TPM
          wizardry. But my heart's in open source! I'm on day 70 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python bootcamp, automating
          web
          scrapers and data crunchers, and I'm all about contributing to the community that powers my daily
          driverâ€”shoutout to the
          Arch Wiki for saving my bacon more times than I can count!
        </p>
